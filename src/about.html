            Huggermuggery is a browser app for clandestine file transfers.
            It solves a very specific problem. It was build to bypass admin 
            policies that disable copy-pasting files between remote desktops.
            It works by stuffing files into the text clipboard. If you can 
            copy-paste text, then you can transfer files.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>On each host, open a browser window to Huggermuggery.</li>
                <li>On the Sender tab
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Drop-and-drop the files you wish to transfer.</li>
                        <li>The File Send Queue should be populated with a list of your files.</li>
                        <li>Click the <b>[Copy to Clipboard]</b> button.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>On the Receiver tab (on the other host)
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li>Paste the contents of your text clipboard into the green textbox.</li>
                        <li>Once you paste, you should see a list of Received Files.</li>
                        <li>
                            To save the files, click the <b>[Save all Files]</b> button.<br>
                            Or you can click the hyperlinks to save individual files.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        
        <p>
            You need to use a modern browser. Huggermuggery was tested in Firefox, Chrome, and Edge.
            It does not work in IE11, which is a shame because on some servers that's all you get.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        
        <p>
            I wrote Huggermuggery for people with a technical skill set. As such, the solutions offered
            here are written with minimal explanation. They're more like hints than full solutions.
        </p>
        
        <h4>The Receiver only downloads the first file, then stops.</h4>
        <p>
        This happens in both Chrome and Firefox (maybe Edge too). It's a safety protocol to prevent a website from flooding your computer with files.
        You have to configure your browser to allow the site to download multiple files. Look for a setting called "Automatic downloads"
        Sometimes the browser will prompt you about the automatic download, look for a red warning icon in the address bar.
        </p>
        
        <h4>I don't have Internet access on the remote host.</h4>
        <p>
            I anticipated this, so I have few workarounds. They still require access to a modern web browser on the remote host.
            <ul>
                <li>If have a way to transfer files to the remote host, download Huggermuggery-portable, and copy to the host.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>If you have access to a modern browser on the host, open <code>about:blank</code>, and copy-paste 
                    <a href="pasteToSave.js.txt">this code</a> into the JS console. The code writes a copy of Huggermuggery-portable to 
                    the browser window, which you can then save locally.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>What inspired me to create this?</h2>
        <p>
            I am a creative problem solver. I am constantly trying to find better solutions to problems.
        </p>
        <p>        
            I had a problem in which I was working with a remote host where a blanket admin policy had disabled 
            file transfers through the OS clipboard. The only method available for transferring files was by
            a cumbersome and slow web portal.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was debugging some code, which required repeated redeployment of the code to the server.
            For the sake of productivity, I needed a faster way to get the code onto the server.       
            Luckily, the text clipboard was not disabled, and I was familiar with base64 encoding. I had a workaround.
            After getting permission from the admins (who were unwilling to enable the file clipboard, but were ok 
            with my workaround), I wrote a quick-and-dirty WinForms app that would let me transfer the files through
            the text clipboard.
        </p>
        <h4>I wrote this browser version for a couple of reasons:</h4>
        <p>
            <b></b>
            <ul>        
                <li>For the fun of it.</li>
                <li>As a portfolio piece.</li>
                <li>Security holes interesting topic.</li>
                <li>To share the tool with others.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>An apology to security admins</h2>
        <p>
            I suspect that some security admins have read the above with a cringe. If file transfer auditing
            is a part of your job, I acknowledge that by publishing Huggermuggery, I've made your job a bit more difficult. 
            I hope that your response will not be to disable the text clipboard on remote desktop sessions, 
            but rather to monitor it for suspicious activity. Disabling the text clipboard will kill user productivity.
            Also there are still <a href="https://github.com/mpgn/ropycat">workarounds</a> for a disabled text clipboard.
        </p>
